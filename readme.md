# Sign2Sound : Sign Language to Speech Convertion Through Action Recognition

## Introduction
In a world where communication serves as the cornerstone of human interaction, individuals with speech impairments face unique challenges in expressing themselves. For those who communicate primarily through sign language, a linguistic gap often separates them from those who are not familiar with this visual and expressive form of communication. Recognizing the need for a bridge between these two worlds, we introduce Sign2Soundâ€”a groundbreaking project aimed at empowering individuals who are non-verbal or face challenges in vocalizing their thoughts.

### Motive of the Project
The primary motivation behind Sign2Sound lies in addressing the communication barriers encountered by individuals who are unable to articulate their thoughts through traditional spoken language. This project seeks to provide a comprehensive solution for individuals with speech impairments, offering them a means to communicate effectively and express themselves using sign language. By leveraging advancements in computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies, Sign2Sound endeavors to create an inclusive environment where the beauty and depth of sign language are seamlessly translated into audible speech.

### Objectives:
The key objectives of Sign2Sound are rooted in enhancing the quality of life for non-verbal individuals. The project aims to:

1. Provide a real-time and intuitive system for capturing sign language gestures through a camera.
2. Convert recognized sign language gestures into coherent and grammatically correct sentences.
3. Enable the transformation of these sentences into natural-sounding speech through text-to-speech synthesis.
4. Facilitate communication between individuals who are proficient in sign language and those who may not understand it, fostering a more inclusive and understanding society.
